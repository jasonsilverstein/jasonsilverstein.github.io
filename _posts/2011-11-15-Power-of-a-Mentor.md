title: Power of a Mentor

In the mid-90s, I started a lifelong friendship with a man named Mick. His care for my success formed the basis of some of my most important management styles, as I worked for him first, left for another job, then ended up with Mick hiring me back to be his producer/boss. Aside from the “treat everyone equally” ethos this exchange taught me, Mick taught me the value of having a good mentor. I’ll explain using one of the many examples I could share of his teachings…

During my first stint at Tar Heel Sports in Chapel Hill, NC, I was in the first professional-life stages of realizing I didn’t really know much about this big world that college just spit me out into. Yet when it came to competitive athletics, I still brimmed with false bravado that I could hang with anyone in just about any sport.

As this story will show, I would be proven wrong, once again. But first, a bit more background.

Mick is about 12-13 years older than I am, and is and was in very good physical shape. Trouble is, he didn’t (and still doesn't) really look the athletic part. He was/is rail thin and pretty much gets you to believe he’s not a threat at anything. Tennis, basketball, golf… whatever sport, he was going to be competitive. And his sneak attacks usually worked.

One off-season Saturday, Mick invited me to join his friends for a “little” 8-miler around town. I’m not sure why the eight miles sticks in my mind so well, but it does. At first, Mick said I was high-stepping and taking the lead — which I did — for about four miles. (Keep in mind that then I was not the runner I am today, meaning I didn’t run at all then and do run a lot now. Yet I still thought I would win. Ha!)

About at mile five we hit Raleigh Rd., a pretty steady yet big hill near the intramural fields. And by “hit” this road, what I really mean is I hit the wall. Hard.

After finally shuffling up past the fields and sucking in more air than one human should be allowed, I still had to cut back through campus, around the Carolina Inn, and head back to Granville Towers, where we’d all parked our cars.

When I finally got back to the lot — in dead last place by probably a physical and definitely an expressive mile — Mick was waiting for me. Everyone else was gone.

I started to say something about “thanks for waiting, and uh… I guess I’m not as good…” when he broke me off. Out came a notebook from his truck, and he read this quote:

“It is not the critic who counts: not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles or where the doer of deeds could have done better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood, who strives valiantly, who errs and comes up short again and again, because there is no effort without error or shortcoming, but who knows the great enthusiasms, the great devotions, who spends himself for a worthy cause; who, at the best, knows, in the end, the triumph of high achievement, and who, at the worst, if he fails, at least he fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who knew neither victory nor defeat.”

It’s a famous quote, but in case it’s new to you it’s Theodore Roosevelt’s “Citizenship in a Republic” Speech at the Sorbonne in Paris. The date Teddy spoke these words publicly was April 23, 1910, but in 1995-ish it was as if he was saying it then to me… Mick definitely has a gift for delivery.

The message simply was to be proud of the effort I’d given. My friend and then boss knew I was a competitive and stubborn type, wanted to do well, yet recognized that even when I was handily beaten that I didn’t quit. That feedback was just what I needed to try harder next time but also to try smarter.

Now fast forward to today and almost 20 years later. This story popped into my mind — perhaps ironically but likely more appropriately — during a 14-mile run during a recent week off work. The previous week, our management team and I had just received company survey results in which several folks said they wanted more chances to work with colleagues on personal development.

I am truly excited to be working on this plan to help development and perhaps more mentoring happen for more people in our office. For in today's fast-paced world and competitive business landscape, knowledge is easy to attain, but it’s the relationships that matter.

And we could all use a mentor like Mick.

(Post-script note: almost three years later, I even more so value mentors both at work and personally. And I'm in a career and life place where I can better give and receive.)
